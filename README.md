### Module 5 Final Assignment

I modified the Module 5 assignment to get a better understanding of Ajax and JSON. The instructor provide an Ajax utility the appeared to be modeled after jQuery. Rather than a third party solution. I tried to write my own. The final product is similar to the menu page for the original assignment, but is based on an imaginary sandwich shop. I used the basic BootStrap responsive layout I created for Assignment 3. Ajax was used to dynamically supply the sandwich information from a local JSON file. I also added a footer. Rather than using BootStrap, I used flexbox for the layout. Way easier!

## Course Review

I would rate the course 3 out of 5. I learned a lot from the course. The instructor covered a lot of material in an easy to understand manner. My main complain is that the content is in serious need of updating. The course was originally create around 2016. While 5 years may not seem that long, for the Internet, it's a lifetime The issues started in the first module. The instructions for setting up a Github account. GitHub had change it's format so the instructions were out of date.

BootStrap was another issue. While the instructions referred to the older version 4, my main issue was that I would have preferred learning the actual css rather than using BootStrap "shortcuts". Most modern wep page layout can easily be done via css flexbox and grid.

If you take the course, just be aware that some of the content is way out of date and you'll need to do some additional research to cover to topics properly.
